# Trading Bot Fixes Documentation

This document explains the issues identified in the trading bot and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Identified

1. **Data Source Problem**: The trader was trying to use Yahoo Finance data instead of the local database files, causing "Required column 'open' not found in data" errors.

2. **Feature Engineering Issues**: The feature engineering process was generating a high number of NaN values (1010-1100 per symbol), which were being cleaned but may have been affecting signal quality.

3. **Model Integration Problems**: While models were loading correctly, the prediction process was failing due to data format mismatches between training and inference.

4. **Trading Logic Errors**: The trading execution logic had issues with position calculations and trade size validation.

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Data Loading Fix

Modified `scripts/trader.py` to use local SQLite database files instead of Yahoo Finance data:

- Added `_load_symbol_data` method to load data from local database files
- Updated `get_market_data` method to use the local database
- Added proper error handling for database connections and data validation

### 2. Feature Engineering Improvements

Enhanced the NaN handling in `src/data_pipeline/features.py`:

- Added more robust NaN detection and handling
- Improved final validation to ensure no NaN or infinite values remain
- Added better logging for debugging purposes

### 3. Preprocessing Consistency

Improved data preprocessing in `src/data_pipeline/preprocess.py`:

- Added better error handling for missing values
- Enhanced validation for infinite values after scaling
- Ensured consistent preprocessing between training and inference

### 4. Trading Logic Corrections

Fixed the position sizing and trade execution calculations in `scripts/trader.py`:

- Improved position calculation based on signal strength and portfolio value
- Added better validation for trade sizes and portfolio updates
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases

### 5. Model Prediction Improvements

Added better error handling and validation to model predictions:

- Enhanced GRU model prediction with preprocessing validation
- Improved LightGBM prediction with input validation
- Added validation for PPO predictions
- Enhanced signal conversion logic with proper error handling

### 6. Debugging Capabilities

Added comprehensive debugging information:

- Enhanced logging throughout the trading process
- Added data quality validation and reporting
- Improved error messages for easier troubleshooting

## Testing

The fixes have been implemented and should resolve the trading execution issues. The bot should now:

1. Load data correctly from local database files
2. Generate features without excessive NaN values
3. Make predictions using all available models
4. Execute trades based on generated signals
5. Provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Future Improvements

Consider implementing the following for further improvements:

1. Add unit tests for critical components
2. Implement more sophisticated risk management
3. Add performance monitoring and reporting
4. Enhance error recovery mechanisms
