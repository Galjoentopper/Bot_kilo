    - Time features: time of day, day of week
    - Custom features: price relative to moving average, indicator crosses, signal combinations
- Input/Output specs:
    - Raw data: CSV format [timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume] per asset
    - Engineered features: pandas DataFrame
    - Model input: N x F numpy arrays (windowed features)
    - Model output: [price, probability, action]

5. Model Training & Evaluation
- Data Preparation:
    - Load 15-min OHLCV data for BTCEUR, SOLEUR, ADAEUR, XRPEUR, ETHEUR.
    - Calculate engineered features and technical indicators.
    - Handle missing data, outliers, and normalize/scale features.
    - Chronological split into train/validation/test sets to prevent lookahead bias.

- Sequence Model (GRU):
    - Window input: Use past N intervals (e.g., last 20 x 15-min features) as input.
    - Output: Next interval price or classification (up/down).
    - Architecture: 1–2 GRU layers, dropout for regularization, dense output.
    - Loss: Mean Squared Error (regression) or Binary Cross-Entropy (classification).
    - Optimization: Adam optimizer, learning rate scheduling, early stopping based on validation loss.
    - Hyperparameter tuning: Grid or random search for sequence length, hidden units, dropout, learning rate.
    - Model checkpointing and logging for reproducibility.

- Feature Model (LightGBM):
    - Input: Engineered features, technical indicators, outputs from GRU model.
    - Output: Predict short-term movement, probability, or return.
    - Loss: Log loss (classification) or RMSE (regression).
    - Optimization: Early stopping, hyperparameter tuning (number of leaves, max depth, learning rate, boosting type).
    - Feature importance analysis to refine engineering.
    - Cross-validation using walk-forward or expanding window methodology.

- RL Model (PPO):
    - Environment: Simulated trading environment with realistic market conditions (slippage, fees).
    - State: Latest engineered features, GRU/LightGBM predictions.
    - Action: Buy/sell/hold, position size.
    - Reward: PnL, risk-adjusted metrics.
    - Training: Multiple episodes over historical data, exploration vs. exploitation balance.
    - Optimization: Tune PPO hyperparameters (gamma, lambda, clip ratio, batch size, learning rate).
    - Regular evaluation and checkpointing.

- Combined/Stacked Model Flow:
    - GRU model generates short-term predictions.
    - LightGBM refines predictions using technical features and GRU outputs.
    - PPO agent receives combined outputs and features for decision making.

- Evaluation & Monitoring:
    - Backtest all models on the test set (walk-forward validation).
    - Metrics: Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, win rate, cumulative return, confusion matrix.
    - Visualize equity curve, prediction accuracy, feature importance.
    - Experiment logging with MLflow or Weights & Biases.

- Automation & Maintenance:
    - Automated scripts for retraining periodically with new data.
    - Modular trainer classes for each model (GRU, LightGBM, PPO).
    - Version control for datasets, models, and experiment configs.
    - Unit tests for data pipeline and trainers.

- Documentation:
    - Notebooks/scripts for EDA, feature engineering, model training.
    - README and docstrings for maintainability.

6. RL Strategy Integration
- Use PPO agent to decide buy/sell/hold and position sizing based on model signals.
- Simulate market environment for RL training.
- Implement risk management and position sizing rules.

7. Deployment
- Paper trading for validation using Bitvavo API.
- Live deployment with Bitvavo exchange API integration.
- Real-time monitoring and logging.
- Runtime: Local or Dockerized container.

8. Notifications
- Integrate Telegram notifier for trade signals and status updates for the paper trader.
- Telegram messages: Text notifications for trade events and errors.
- Add optional Slack/email notifications for critical alerts.

9. Maintenance & Iteration
- Periodic retraining with new data.
- Continuous backtesting and parameter tuning.

10. Data Requirements
- Crypto pairs: BTCEUR, SOLEUR, ADAEUR, XRPEUR, ETHEUR
- Data type: 15-min OHLCV, order book, trade history
- Technical indicators: RSI, MACD, MA, Bollinger Bands, etc.
- Time range: 1–2 years recommended

11. Security & Secrets Management
- Secrets (API keys, tokens) stored in `.env` files and loaded securely.
- Never commit credentials to version control.
- Use environment variables or a secrets manager for deployment.

12. Configuration Management
- All configs stored in `src/config/config.yaml`
- Configurable parameters: asset list, model hyperparameters, notification channels

13. Error Handling & Edge Cases
- Retry failed API calls up to 3 times
- Log all errors to `logs/`
- Skip intervals with missing data, notify via Telegram

14. Module Interfaces
- `Trainer.train(data: pd.DataFrame) -> TrainedModel`
- `Trader.run(model: TrainedModel) -> None`
- `Notifier.send(msg: str) -> None`

15. Testing & Validation
- Unit tests for all modules (`tests/`)
- Backtest results must log Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- All code must pass tests before deployment

16. Example Data Row
timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume
2024-01-01 00:00, 41000.0, 41100.0, 40900.0, 41050.0, 1.52

17. Documentation Style
- Docstrings for all public functions/classes
- README with setup, usage, and troubleshooting
- Inline comments for complex logic

18. Project Goals
- Bot must achieve Sharpe ratio > 1.0 in backtests
- Telegram notifications must be instant (<5s latency)
- All code must pass tests before deployment

19. Next Steps
- Set up repository structure.
- Assign tasks for each step.
- Draft initial code and documentation.
